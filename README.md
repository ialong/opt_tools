# opt_tools
Tools for logging an optimisation procedure. Specially designed to work with scipy and GPflow.

See the `./examples/` directory to see how to use.

## Use within other repositories
I usually add this as a git subtree:

```
git remote add st-opt_tools git@github.com:markvdw/opt_tools.git
git subtree add --prefix=opt_tools/ st-opt_tools master
```
